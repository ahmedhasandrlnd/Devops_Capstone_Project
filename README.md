A Pipeline is a set of tools and processes to automate the CI/CD.

* Continuous Integration (CI) means newly developed code changes of a project are periodically built, tested, and integrated into a shared repository like Git. Then, the integrated code is verified and tested using automated tools.

* Continuous Delivery (CD) is the process of automating the release of the merged and validated code to a repository and finally release a production-ready build to the production environment.
